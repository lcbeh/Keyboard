## Keyboard

Keyboard is a simple app written in JavaScript, inspired by the the Drum Kit app in JavaScript30 tutorial. I have revised to have the sound of piano keys to map unto alphanumeric keys on the keyboard. It's always fun to build something you like, even though there are great products on the market.
